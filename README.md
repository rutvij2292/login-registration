# Welcome to the login-registration wiki!

I designed this very basic login-registration system using PHP, MySQL, jQuery, HTML5 and CSS.

For designing purpose, I copied the template from the internet and I select very basic tabular based form.

# How to Use it
1. Download the zip or clone repository to Git directory.
2. Create Database in MySQL.
3. Upload user_details.sql file in your database.
4. Replace dbconfig.php file with your credentials and database name.
5. Now, you can register/login into the system. NOTE: Implemented login registration only.

# BUGS
I am trying to fix the bug of error, when user is already registered with the same email address.
